# Metrics and Integration

So far we have discussed manifolds without adding a notion of distance between two points. Here we do this using a metric. The idea is that a distance is simply a volume of a manifold with dimension 1. If we have a generalized definition of a volume then we can come up with a definition of distance.

## Orientation

To define an orientation we need vectors, in particular an oriented basis at every point of the manifold. Notice that changing the basis
